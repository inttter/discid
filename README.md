# Installation

```bash
npm install -g discid
```

# Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The user must be [in the Lanyard Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/lanyard). If the user you try searching for a user that is not in the server, you will get an error reminding you of this.

```bash
discid <userId>
```

In order to find the ```<userId>``` of a user:

* Enable Developer mode by going to: **Settings** ➔ **Advanced** ➔ **Developer Mode**, and check the toggle.
* Right click on a user and click [```Copy User ID```](https://github.com/inttter/inttter/assets/73017070/0ffacc8d-06c9-4521-97eb-62295aa67b73)
* Go back to your command line and run ```discid <userId>``` replacing ```<userId>``` with the ID you copied.

For example:

```bash
discid 514106760299151372
```

might return something like:

```bash
iinter • 🟢 Online
Listening To: Duvet by bôa on Twilight
Platform: Desktop
```

as the status of the user is "Online" and listening to the song in question at the time the command was ran:
