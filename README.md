# Installation

To run `discid` on your machine, install it using npm:

```bash
npm install -g discid
```

# Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The user must be in the [Lanyard Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/lanyard) in order to retrieve information about them.

```bash
discid [userID]
```

You will need to replace `[userID]` with the ID of the user you are trying to fetch the status of. To find the ID of a user, you can follow a [guide with images](https://iinter.me/writing/using-discid#how-do-you-find-a-user-id), or you can follow the steps below:

1. Enable Developer Mode by going to **Settings** âž” **Advanced** âž” **Developer Mode**, and check the toggle to be on.

2.  Right click on a user and click the [`Copy User ID`](https://iinter.me/images/using-discid/copy-user-id.png) button.

3. Go back to your command line and run the same command from above, replacing `[userID]` with the ID you copied.

For example, to check the status of the user `iinter`, you can run the following command:

```bash
discid 514106760299151372
```

Depending on what the user is doing, you may get different outputs. Here is an example of what might be returned:

```bash
lunar (iinter) â€¢ ðŸŸ¢ Online (Desktop)
Listening To: Never More by Shihoko Hirata â€¢ 3min 42sec left
Avatar URL: https://api.lanyard.rest/514106760299151372.png
```
